# Preprocessing-tool

## “If the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail.”
## *Abraham Maslow*

### Every data science project is unique, that's why it is a best practice to always make your custom code for data cleaning and pre processing, but..

### Sometimes you just wanna compare classification or regression algotitms, make a quick prototipation, test, or even learn a new toll. In this cases you don't want to spend too much time clening and pre processing data, so thas is when it is a good ideia to have a preprocessing-tool around.

### In the file [example_usage](example_usage.ipynb) you can find a datailed example that uses all package's methods, and their main functionalities.
